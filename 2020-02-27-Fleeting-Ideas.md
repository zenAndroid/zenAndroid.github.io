Hey, here today for a quick post.

So, I have just finished Chapter 3 of SICP, and of course I'm going to be posting a blog post somewhat soonish about it, but before doing that I want to expand on an idea I just had.

I look at something like sarabander's effort on making sicp beautiful and I like it, but I also want to attempt to contribute something non-negligible to the community ... 

More specifically, I'm thinking of contributing in the sense of publishing my SICP notes more publicly and in a more presentable fashion.

Not that the GitHub repo is not presentable, but ... You know .. Would be nice if something else that is more aesthetic can be achieved.

And so therefore, I've been thinking about putting up some website (nothing too fancy, GitHub pages will do) where not only I document the solution, but I also **complement them with my thoughts, possibly explanations even**.

I still did not plan seriously what to do, which structure I'll follow, which framework I'll use, but possibly, the simpler the better.

Maybe something like revealJS if I feel extra fancy, but that will pose a series of questions, because revealJS is pretty much just a presentation engine, so ... Maybe I'll just stick with a regular old tried and true regular website format ... Heck maybe I'll do it in this blog even, ... Although maybe in another branch that can be accessed through zenandroid.github.io/sicp or something ...

Anyway, just a fleeting thought I had about a neat little project I could do, ... There are little problems like the fact that I'm going to need to reread Chapter 1 and carefully redo all the exercises and stuff. ~~but that's not actually a problem at all hah~~

This will also help me get more out of SICP I hope, even if I don't actually do it, And I must not forget that I can reuse my comments, so that's a plus.
