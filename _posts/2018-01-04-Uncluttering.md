I really need to get rid of a lot of stuff that's just distracting fluff in my life.


Now this ain't no personal blog or something like that, but it heavily impacts my productivity and
thus my life.

This realization came to me when i was writing a ToDo for 2018 (*that is now removed* , but all you
need to know is that it contained a list of all the things i was planning on doing at 2018) , looking at all
the things that I've put up in that list, even though they don't seem much, and as i mentioned in
that same post, i might even be tempted by other stuff ...

In a later blog post i think i will talk about the sunk cost fallacy, then i will probably talk
about say LaTeX and/or scheme and other ... `things` in general.

When i analyze each component individually, each of them seems important enough to stick with, so i
have to watch out not to fall for that trap.

And well, i guess if *you* have any ideas or advice, then, feel free to comment.


I hope those disqus comments don't break someday, ... Cause that would be pretty ... Uncool.


## BONUS :

Ironic, as i was talking about this i found this to be my setup.
![Minimalism]({{"/assets/minimalism.png" | absolute_url}})
Gave me a good idea actually and i think i might stick with it.
