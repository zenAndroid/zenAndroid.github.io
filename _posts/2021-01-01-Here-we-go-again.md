New year ...

Yay, I guess.

Not really interested in making a drawn out introduction post, I'm not going to bother.

## Why the disappearance this time, zen? ##

- My Linux kernel panicked, I found myself in a situation where I couldn't afford to really try and fiddle with it and fix it, and so I didn't.
- Just started using Windows because with college and such I couldn't afford the distraction (but I kept feeling a voice in my head going all *this is only an excuse and you know it*, I ignored it even though I knew it might have had a point ...)
- Anyways, months fly by, here I am now.
- I look at the Linux OS I had installed, it kernel panicked every time, and I did a quick estimation and remembered that there weren't really any interesting files in the Linux partition that I didn't have in the Windows install anyways, so I just ... overwrote the Linux partitions and installed something new, this time tho, I went with something different and installed MX-Linux, kinda new, and I guess I won't have i3 installed, but I wanted to not waste any time on that stuff and just *finish my initial work on SICP*, and long story short, I believe I'm at that point now, so that's good (I skipped a lot of stuff, but I might talk about that later, not that its particularly important though)
- I found out some interesting software and I still have some interesting ideas that I want to talk about.

## Weird title but OK ... ##

It's relevant I promise!

You see, I have a lot of things to talk about, but I don't think I'm going to talk about them in this post, rather I only want to talk about three things:
- I want to comment on my experience on using spaced repetition tools.
- I want to gloat about having implemented commenting functionality in this blog (yes, yes, I know, finally)
- And I want to recount my current progress with SICP :)
