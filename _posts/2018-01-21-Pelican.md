# Things and stuff, part 2

By the way, did you read the [Things and stuff]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url
2017-12-25-Things-and-stuff %}) post, in it i talk about this blog and the underlying structure
of it (jekyll and liquid etc...)



I don't think i mentioned it in that post, but when i forked Hyde from its original repository *(and
then subsequently reuploaded it without forking it)*, i could only make local changes **then** push
them to see their effect online.

I couldn't build the site locally, which was not a very bad thing but it was still a bummer since i
had to re-push every time i noticed a mistake in the latest edit (whether it was a new post or a CSS
edit or whatever), i also couldn't deal with themes as easily, because yeah i admit this theme is
good but what if i saw something better, i also couldn't ...

To summarize : i felt my jekyll install was fragile and couldn't change much stuff without fear of
breaking something (sure, in the beautiful era of Versioning Control Systems, that fear is a bit
dampened, but not having these problems is a far better alternative than not having them)

And when the build fails, (~~just as it did when i first pushed *this* post~~), things get ...
complicated, especially if the build error isn't there (ie generic build error) (~~just as it did when i first pushed *this* post~~) because then it's just a guessing game and nobody likes to play those.

In my case it was an extension i've added i shouldn't have when linking to the first things and
stuff post, ... yeah no need to clap haha i only spent fifteen minutes before figuring that out haha

Enter pelican.

Aren't pelicans cute ?

Not really ? I agree.


## Pelican 

Pelican is a static site generator, written in Python.

* Write content in [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) or [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using your editor of choice.
* Includes a simple command line tool to (re)generate site files.
* Easy to interface with version control systems and web hooks.
* Completely static output is simple to host anywhere.

## Features

Pelican currently supports:

* Chronological content (e.g., articles, blog posts) as well as static pages.
* Integration with external services (e.g., Google Analytics and Disqus).
* Site themes (created using [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) templates).
* Publication of articles in multiple languages.
* Generation of Atom and RSS feeds.
* Syntax highlighting via [Pygments](http://pygments.org/).
* Importing existing content from WordPress, Dotclear, and other services.
* Fast rebuild times due to content caching and selective output writing.


Check out Pelican's documentation for further information.

## Why the name "Pelican" ?

"Pelican" is an anagram of *calepin*, which means "notebook" in French.

# Pelican ... a better alternative ?

All i can say right now, is that i just discovered this, so my knowledge about is null at the time
I'm writing this, i will read the docs, see if it's worth it.

I'm also concerned when it comes to the style/theme, will i be able to replicate Hyde ?
The other side of course being that a lot of possibilities are opening up, i hope.
Well, i'll see how it goes.
