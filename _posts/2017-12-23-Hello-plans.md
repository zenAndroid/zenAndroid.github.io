# Plans:
So, since I'm gonna post about some of my thought processes might as well start with my thought
processes concerning the plan/structure of this blog.

### Things that are sure to be mentioned around here:

Well, for one i will definitely talk about my vim experience and progress.

For two, i will definitely mention LaTeX here and there.

Hmm, probably a few posts about this blog and the technical difficulties i might encounter with it.

Also, .... Game theory ? Perhaps ?

Also whatever else comes up like mini-articles about some little nifty trick i discovered or opinion
about something tech related (because i don't want to include topics concerning shows/books or
whatnot here, kinda want to make this purely tech related to give it a ... 'professional feel' i guess
?)
