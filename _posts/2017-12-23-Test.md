description: Testing ground for the functionalities of the blog, kind of a scary post to me, because there is a risk i walk in on it and something is not working which, knowing me, will disable me until i fix said functionality no matter its actual concrete utility. #wakeMeUp

This post will be used as a testing post, i will test in it any weirdness that comes up or any funky plugin i'm trying to set up.

I think i'll leave this post and the 'test body' untouched for posterior hilarity :smile:

## Images : 

Image test.

## 25 December :

Testing MathJax, the math LaTeX rendering javascript extension included in kramdown.

$$
\begin{align*}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots         & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{align*}
$$

WHY IS IT NOT WORKING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA


$$ 5+5=10 $$

$$ 5 \times 5 = 25 $$

$$ \frac{x}{y} = 78 $$

sadness and sorrow

```c
int add(int x,int y){
    int result;
    result = x;
    result += y;
    result += 8888;
    result -= 7588;
    result /= 0;
    // stop taking this example seriously 
    return "potato";
}
```
