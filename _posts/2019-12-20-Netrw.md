# Friendship ended with NERDTree #

Now Netrw is my bestfriend.

## Hindsight is 20/20 ##

You know it's weird sometimes, I've spent a decent amount of time using NERDTree, even if i heard of and knew the existence of Netrw, I thought to myself that it's probably complicated and requires more setup or some such configuration.

## I was wrong ##

Nope, Built-in, Out of the box, Netrw just, *exists* and *werks*.

Now instead of `:NerdTreeToggle`, you type in `:Netrw` and you get yourself a listing.

![Hexplore]({{ "/assets/Hexplore.png" | relative_url }}  "Netrw command")

There are various Exploring commands:

- Explore
- Hexplore
- Lexplore
- Nexplore
- Pexplore
- Rexplore
- Sexplore
- Texplore
- Vexplore

And they are all detailed in the vim help files ...

### I'd like to take a moment ###

And just appreciate the absolute beauty that is the vim `:help` command, and the vim help system.

I mean, it's just beautiful and amazing that you can have each and every possible vim command explained to you in depth.

And sometimes I take a glance at it, just to remind myself of some parts/possibilities ...

### Enough fanboying ###

![Horizontal Netrw Window]({{ "/assets/Netrw.png" | relative_url }}  "Result of the previous command")

I have begun reading the docs today, expecting the entire process of learning the basics would take me a bit long, ...

Only to find that really If i want to get going, it's really quite simple; 
The most important things to know to make an *incredily* long story short is :
- Enter to edit a file/explore a directory
- `o`, unlike NERDTree, explores the directory in a new horizonal netrw window.
- `-`   Makes Netrw go up one directory
- `c`,  Make browsing directory the current directory
- `p`,  Preview the file
- `t`,  Enter the file/directory under the cursor in a new tab
- `v`,  Enter the file/directory under the cursor in a new window
- `%`,  Open a new file in netrw's current directory


And there are SO many other things to read, but i just listed the ones that i used often in NERDTree (well, some are new to me, like `%`)

Anyways, I shall be seeing if this is sufficient, but i will read the doc regarding browsing for sure.

<b>Kinda shook at how there was this golden trove and i didn't see it</b>

Makes you think ... what else is there ?
