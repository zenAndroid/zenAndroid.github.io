description: In which I outline my tentative plan for partitioning my system in order to install M A N J A R O with the i3 community install

# Steps for partitioninig #

There shoud be a:
- /  partition
- /home partition
- swap partition

## / partition ##

From 20 to 50 GB
Could be less than that
Minimum of 7gb
I am going to go fo 25 Gigs

The mount point, of course is /
The fils system ext4

## home partition ##
As much space as you can spare ...
mount point /home

## swap partition ##

Linuxswap
2-4 GB

    
# One last task #

One last task that needs to be completed here before moving to the next step, is specify the ESP. That should be /dev/sdb2, so click on it.

Put its mount point as /boot/efi


# Update Grub #

If all goes well, you still wont be able to boot into windows for the moment.
- boot into manjaro
- SUDO UPDATE-GRUB

## My setup ##

My current setup is this :
![My current partition scheme]({{"/assets/current_partition_scheme.png" | absolute_url }})


So, what I'm thinking is:
- The 48,83 Gigs partition will be the '/' one.
- I will shrink the C: partition to fit the other ones:
    - Swap : probably will make it 4 Gigs
    - Home : probably will make it .... 75 Gigs ... eh .. yeah why not ..

### Consensus ###
So the only things left for me to do right now (won't install right now, don't have the live media) is to shrink C to make space for a new 80 Gigs partition.


# The test #

What I am unsure about is if or not an install can have non-contiguous partitions.
