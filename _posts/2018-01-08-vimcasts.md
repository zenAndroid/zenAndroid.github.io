Quick short post.

The [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/) website seems pretty interesting.

Will start watching casts, until I'm bored that is.

There are also some articles that i think i might read.

The episodes are [here](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/), knock yourself out !

As of the date I'm writing this page, there are 75 posts, there is no explicit way to reach the first post, but there are 10 posts per page so to get to the start i guess you take the number of posts in total, divide that by 10, and insert the rounded value in ``http://vimcasts.org/episodes/page/<RESULT>``.

## But zen, that got me to the second page, not the first.

You're welcome.

[I think this](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/cleaning-up-with-vim/) might be a good summary of all of vims feature neatly packed into a less than-a-minute video
