# Great, great channel :

Now, i know a lot of good YouTube channels, but i just absolutely love [Luke
smith's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA) YouTube channel because at the
end of the day, every time i finish one of his videos, i find myself with some practical knowledge
that can help, and i say this right now because i just finished watching one of his videos (The ones
about [RMarkdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWScm5WI3fo), [and another
one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J5a0JWIF-0)), and i will make a post about that some time
around as well.

God there are so many posts i have to write.
