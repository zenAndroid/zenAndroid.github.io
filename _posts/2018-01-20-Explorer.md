Hey, have you ever wanted to jump from the command line straight to the window explorer in the
current directory ?

[TEST]

Well, i did at least and the first thing i thought would work was ``explorer cd`` or ``explorer .``

That doesn't work, and instead just opens explorer on the vanilla documents folder.

The command for doing that is ``start``.

#### Example :

![This command]({{"/assets/start_command.png" | absolute_url}})

results in ;

![this]({{"/assets/start_command_result.png" | absolute_url}})

## How does this work ?
Still not sure exactly but the ``start`` DOS command takes the argument, starts the correct
process using the extension and the file association, so when you throw a directory its way, it
opens it using explorer, happy days !

### Note :

If a directory name has spaces on it, you're gonna have a bad time, because the start command would
then just start another instance of ``cmd.exe`` with whatever is in quotes as the title of that
instance.

So ![this]({{"/assets/start_command_fail.png" | absolute_url}}) would lead to
![this]({{"/assets/start_command_fail2.png" | absolute_url}}).
