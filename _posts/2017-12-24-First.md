### Okay well, first things first.
Let's talk about ~~that black stripe you see on the left of the screen (or the right if i changed
that (or the top if you're on mobile))~~ the sidebar navigator.

It originally had 4 links on it,
<ul>
    <li>Home</li>
    <li>About</li>
    <li>Download</li>
    <li>Github project</li>
</ul>
And then a string showing the version off.


I don't exactly want nor need this.

I am thinking of something more like;
<ul>
    <li>Home</li>
    <li>About</li>
    <li>Archives</li>
</ul>

Simple, clear, and no extra fuss.

The archives is basically a list of all the posts, maybe after reading some more of the doc i can
allow myself to get creative, but until then I'll just take anything i can get (for instance the
code snippet included in the [Writing posts | jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) page)


And since i might as well link the Github repo in the about page, so no need to add that ugliness.

I am a big fan of minimalism ...... Well, when it suits me.


## The about page:

I need to also make some modifications to the about page to add a `# Credits` or `# Thanks:`
section where i give credit where it's due.




#### After >5 hours:

Okay, well, i think I'll stop tweaking every little thing here for a while at least.

Risk/return calculations disadvantageous, disengaging ...

I'll start thinking about this in terms of what it is : *a blog* and only start planning posts.

I'll definitely try to improve it though.

<small>Oh by the way I'll definitely tweak a bit of the archive page just to make the post date appear and
what not. ~~heheeheheheheheh please help me~~</small>

Also crap i need to do the thing i said about the `# About: ` page.

Also test out images :thinking:

Oh also gotta see if i can get emojis to work

###### A few hours later:
![ha]({{"assets/tired.jpg" | absolute_url }})

First of all, i would like to start by saying that i am not tired.

:smile:
Definitely not tired.

:simple_smile:
 <ul>
    <li>I still need to do that `# About`page thing.</li>
    <li>I tested out images, i think they're good !</li>
    <li>I'll let you guess about the emoji part </li>
</ul>

...<sup>sigh</sup>

I think i should uh sleep.

But wait lemme just fix the archives pages here *cuz you see the Github flavored markdown doesnt
work, so i need to write the table manually in good'ol HTML*

:weary:


## Success :

Archive page success.

That feels good.

Feels *really* good.

###### ALLRIGHT :
it's 2 : 30 AM, i just spent close to 13 hours fiddling around, i think this is it or almost for
HTML, round 2 of course is for CSS.
