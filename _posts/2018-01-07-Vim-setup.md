# Abstract:

In this post i will share my vim setup, my vim configuration file (aka vimrc), and i'll talk about
other things i've set up to help with my LaTeX development.

### The vimrc :

Here is the [vimrc]({% link /assets/_vimrc %}) file.

### Comments :

So, there are a lot of things that you probably already know if you've already dealt with Vim
before.

But in case you're new, i'll explain most of them :
#### Options :

I've used the [VimConfig - Sane and simple vim configuration](http://vimconfig.com/) site to
generate the generic stuff, then i added wildmenu and some other ones.
The comments should be clear enough, though i admit some are pretty vague, if you want to know
exactly what an option does, then you don't even have to quit vim for the most part, you can just
type `help <command>` and the help file will open up on a horizontal split on that split, and there
you can read at your leisure.

Which is something *i like a lot about vim, the help you'll get is pretty much 100% complete*, you
still might want to check out the internet if you want to see it being used, also because sometimes
the vim documentation can be a bit too specific or abstract.

#### Additions :
In addition to this you can see i added quite a bit of stuff, like ``let g:tex_flavor="latex"`` so
vim doesn't get confused when editing a .tex file, then the following lines add Vundle to the
runtime path, load all the plugins (which may vary of course).
