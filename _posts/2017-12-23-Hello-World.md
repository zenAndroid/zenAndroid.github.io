## Welp !

It is with great joy that i announce that i kinda made this work, or at least that's definitely
what i hope.


### Introducing *zenBlog*

Welcome to this blog, it is a blog in which i shall __try__ to document my various "adventures"
or thought processes when learning new concepts.

In the second or third post i will probably write a good long rant about the process of setting
up this blog itself, because God knows the struggle i went through , oh by the way do emojis
work in here ? :thinking: guess I'll find out soon enough :smile: (i hope they do though)
