# Guess who really hates procrastinating but is doing it yet ?

Not me i swear.


## Madness :

I loaded an image in a pelican mock blog, served it in `localhost:8080`, and noticed that it didn't
fit; it loaded full size.

I panicked then i thought could it be a pelican bug ?

Probably not though, so i thought "hey since i hate myself anyways, i think i'll recreate the entire
Hyde theme in here :)" and no i didn't like the one available in the repo.

So here i am, am going to try it, if it doesn't work, i guess i'll go for another theme and if all
else fails ill try out Hugo next and if *that* fails i'll just ... Stay with my lousy jekyll setup
... I say __my__ jekyll setup but really i don't do jekyll, Github pages does :(

Well, there goes zen, squandering his life again ~~do i even have a life at this point though~~.
*another rabbit hole, another templating system, another static website engine* make it stop
